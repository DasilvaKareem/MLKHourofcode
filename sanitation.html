    <p>The sanitation strike was a success after Martin Luther King became involved. Years prior sanitation workers were ignored. Dr. King's speech to 15,000 atendees motivated the mayor and locals for a reform. Sanitation workers were given a $70,000 retirement and improved conditions at work.</p>
