     <p>September 16, 1963 brought news of one of the most horrific acts of hate and violence ever perpetrated during the Civil Rights movement. Four young black girls–Addie Mae Collins, Carol Denise McNair, and Cynthia Diane Wesley, and Carole Robertson–were killed in a church bombing planned by white supremacists. </p>
